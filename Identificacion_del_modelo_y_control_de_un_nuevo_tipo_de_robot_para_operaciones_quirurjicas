Continuous robot technology is inspired by life
forms in nature, it is physically very flexible and has a nonlinear
behavior. In addition, its dynamics are not unique, which
makes its study a challenge. In this paper we are going to carry
out a study on two control methods for the system of a continuous
robotic manipulator, the control by sliding modes allows us to
follow the trajectory of an estimated value, but it presents an
error known as Chattering, which is solved from a saturation
function. While the LQR control allows us to minimize the cost
of a system from two intuitively chosen matrices and its control
law is obtained by feedback.
